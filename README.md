This script is the first one which I've made in Bash. 
I am aware that it is not perfect and there are more specified tools for this task, but my goal in creating it was to learn how to make something more complex in this scripting language. 
The script creates a .tar archive from files in /home/user directory.

It is running by .timers files (soon included) in a day/time specified by the user.

Also, in addition to this script, I've created another script which removes old tar files. The remove.sh script removes old .tar files.
Like the main script it can be run by .timer file to automate it.
